# Stata command `paralellize`

## Introduction

Although a fairly large number of commands in Stata are internally paralellized,
the speed of execution of specfic algorithms such as bootstrapping, jacknifing and imputation 
could be accellarated by utilizing a computing cluster. `paralellize` would help researchers 
in parallelizing their analyses and submitting jobs to the computing cluster at Boston College.

We will post more details on our development effort as they become avaialble! 

Stay tuned!
